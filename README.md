<h1 align="center">Auctions Api</h1>
<p align="center">Auctions Api platform built on top of Laravel</p>

### About this project
This system will house the API and all logic needed to run a auctions system. Seeing as this is a api, you can integrate this into any frontend you desire, current and future builds.

This will be built with multi-tenecy in mind, which means you can host this api in one location, but have multiple users consume this API.


#### How Does It Work
There are 2 ways of approaching this system. Either through your own frontend/backend or through the admin panel that comes with this api.
Each method will have its own set of instructions on what needs to be done.
